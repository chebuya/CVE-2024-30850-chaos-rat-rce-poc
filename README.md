# CHAOS RAT web panel RCE
https://github.com/tiagorlampert/CHAOS <br>

This exploit works by spoofing a agent callback for an XSS, and leveraging the XSS to exploit a command injection vulnerability in the admin web panel.  This leads to compromise of the RAT server and rickrolling of RAT panel operators.
